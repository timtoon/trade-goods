# About

A pure JavaScript calculator of trade good dice modifiers for use in the Traveller role-playing game (Mongoose 2nd Edition, 2016). Generate DMs for available/illegal trade goods from an eight-character [Universal World Profile](https://wiki.travellerrpg.com/Universal_World_Profile). Download and run in your own web browser at your convenience.

This is a companion to Sir Poley's [On Creating a Frictionless Traveller, Part I: Trade](https://sirpoley.tumblr.com/post/643218580118323200/on-creating-a-frictionless-traveller-part-i).

Post any bugs or feature requests here, or [contact me](http://www.timtoon.com/contact/).

## Law Levels and Contraband

As Poley noted, the categories of contraband (weapons, drugs, technology, etc.) don't mesh perfectly with the categories of trade goods, so I have ruled that these good are illegal for those government types only past a certain law level, provided in the list of trade good categories. Adjust or ignore as needed.
